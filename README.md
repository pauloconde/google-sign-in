## Welcome! ðŸŽ‰

In this project we learn how to implement the Sign In with Google flow using Expo.

Sign In With Google helps you to quickly and easily manage user authentication and sign-in to your website.
Users sign into a Google Account, provide their consent, and securely share their profile information with your platform.

## Dependencies

```bash
expo install expo-auth-sessions
expo install expo-web-browser
expo install expo-random

//for building on android
expo install expo-updates
```

## Conclusion

Using google sign in provides a better user experience although we need to configure a few extra steps.
